    "maintenanceInfoWhy": "Why is this happenin'?",
    "maintenanceInfoWhyText": "For the past several months, we have been thoroughly revamping Habitica behind-the-scenes. Specifically, we have rewritten the API.

    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText1": "You will NOT take any damage or lose any streaks that weekend, but otherwise, your day will reset normally! Dailies that you checked will become unchecked, buffs will reset, etc. If you are in a Collection Quest, you will still find items. If you are in a Boss Battle, you will still deal damage to the Boss, but the Boss will not deal damage to you. (Even monsters need a break!)",
    "maintenanceInfoStatsAffectedText2": "Aft a lot o' thought, our crew concluded that this was th' most fair way t' handle th' fact that many users will nah be able t' check off thar Dailies normally durin' th' maintenance. We're sorry fer any inconvenience this causes!",

'n if ye already 'ave a Veteran Wolf 'n a Veteran Tiger, ye will receive a ne'er-afore-seen Veteran pet! Aft th' migration be completed, it may loot several hours fer yer pet t' show up, but ne'er fear, everyone will get one.",
